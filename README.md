# MAXJsonAdapter

MAXJsonAdapter is intended for user who want simple serialization of their model objects who do not want to require to subclass their objects with frameworks such as Mantle.

Subclassing is a vital aspect of programming and most of the time we would like to have control over our root subclasses and not require third party subclasses which we do not control. This project allows you to easily create model objects from json and vice versa.
